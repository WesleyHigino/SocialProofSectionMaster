# Social proof section

This is a challenge from the Mentor interface to create a "social proof section". The goal of the challenge was to make the project as close as possible to the proposed project. With this challenge I was able to improve my skills with the flex box and with the position property. In this project I also improved my concepts of responsiveness.
